# Digital-Marketing-Campaign
This project demonstrates a comprehensive SQL workflow to clean, enrich, and analyze a raw digital marketing dataset. The goal is to transform messy, incomplete data into clear, actionable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Revenue, ROAS (Return on Ad Spend), and CPA (Cost per Acquisition) to support strategic decision-making.
